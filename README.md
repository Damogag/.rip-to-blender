# .rip-to-blender
This is a python script to import .rip files from ninjaripper into blender

you might need to change the 'dir' variable to your folder with the rip files you want to import

otherwise use the script and code with whatever you want or yell at me about bugs

PS: i know the code is shit, i learned python while coding this, but hey! At least it works'ish
